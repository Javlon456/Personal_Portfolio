            <p>My name is Javon Long, and I was born here in Lancaster, PA on October 22nd, 2002. I grew up fascinated with computers and technology when I was young and looked up to my uncle who is an engineer. As I grew older I became more interested in computers and how they worked as well as software development. I've come a long way since then and have completed an Associate's Degree in Applied Science where I learned about various programming languages and techniques that go into software development.</p>
